# Soding Mobile developer Assessment

This is my submission for Soding programming assignment for Mobile developer

### Prerequisites

Python is required to run the program

## Running the tests

run "python soding_test.py" in a Python environment and enter "4000000" to get the output

## App walkthrough

The App calculates Fibonacci sequence for a given value. It uses caching to speed up the 
processing for large numbers. It calculates the sum of even values less than the value the 
user intputs when the app runs (4000000 for this assignment)
